# Bluetooth-Controlled-RC-Car-using-Arduino-Uno
This project demonstrates how to control a 4-wheel drive (4WD) robotic car using an Arduino Uno and a Bluetooth module (HC-05/HC-06). The car responds to commands sent via a Bluetooth controller app on a smartphone, allowing it to move forward, backward, left, right, and diagonally.

📌 Features
✅ Bluetooth-Controlled Movement – Control the car wirelessly using a mobile app.
✅ Multiple Movement Modes – Supports basic directions (F, B, L, R) and diagonal moves.
✅ Speed Adjustment – Motors can run at different speeds for smooth turns.
✅ Arduino & AFMotor Library – Uses the AFMotor library to drive the DC motors.

🛠️ Hardware Requirements
1] Arduino Uno
2] L293D Motor Driver Shield (Adafruit Motor Shield)
3] HC-05/HC-06 Bluetooth Module
4] 4 DC Motors
5] 12V Battery Pack
6] Jumper Wires
7] Smartphone with Bluetooth Controller App

 *] Installation & Usage
1️⃣ Install the AFMotor library in the Arduino IDE.
2️⃣ Upload the Arduino sketch to the Arduino Uno.
3️⃣ Connect the HC-05 Bluetooth module to the Arduino.
4️⃣ Pair your phone with HC-05 and use a Bluetooth terminal app.
5️⃣ Send the respective commands to control the car.

🏗 Future Improvements
🛠 Speed Control – Adjust speed dynamically using PWM.
📱 Custom App – Create a dedicated app for a better UI.
📷 Camera Module – Add a wireless camera for FPV (First-Person View).
